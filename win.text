@goldenglobes Sofia Vergara did not win!
What the hell is this HBO show that just won on #GoldenGlobes??? I've never heard of this crap. But Julianne Moore is in it so...
It's a fair trade off. The wife watched the Falcons win earlier now, I take in the Golden Globes.

@Chels725 @goldenglobes I know this is silly, but I like to think that the winners are decided moments before they actually win.
I have never watched a TV movie or mini-series. Oh, wait, I did watch "Project ALF." It didn't win a #GoldenGlobes. It was robbed.
Congrats to Christoph Waltz, Maggie Smith and Game Change on their wins! #GoldenGlobes
The fact that people win AWARDS making fun of Republicans should tell the GOP to just go the fuck home. #GoldenGlobes

I truly believe Leo Dicaprio has been blackballed by the Hollywood Awards/Film Industry. He is a fantastic actor &amp; NEVER wins. #GoldenGlobes
"Christopher Waltz won a previous Golden Globe for his role as a violent anti-semite, a role made famous by Mel Gibson." #GoldenGlobes
Disappointed that Sofia Vergara never wins! Seriously... What's up with that?! #GoldenGlobes
Si los #GoldenGlobes Fuesen en Venezuela El Fashion Police lo haria el tierrudo de la hojilla.. Como se llama el won ese?

Re: Golden Globes. Put Homeland table closer to the stage. They are always going to win every award.
I was mad that Homeland won for a lackluster second season, but then I remember it was the Golden Globes, and I laughed it off.
I'm also hoping that Claire Danes says "Holla, Mandy Patinkin!" for the second time when she wins later on tonight #GoldenGlobes
Strike one of #GoldenGlobes Bryan Cranston losing Best Actor. If #LesMiserables doesn't win anything I'll call the HFPA myself. #recount
Walter White deserved the win. #GoldenGlobes
Yay! Congratulations @lewis_damian and @SHO_Homeland on #GoldenGlobes win!! My favorite show!! &lt;3

Jennifer Lawrence wins best dress. I hope she wins for Best Supporting Actress in Silver Linings Playbook too! #goldenglobes
Have no idea what's happening on the #GoldenGlobes. I've only seen one film that's won an award so far..
Ok, watching golden globes, #Homeland didn't deserve to win over #thenewsroom #globes I love homeland. But there are better shows...

#GoldenGlobes  Darn, #Homeland!  I really would LOVE to see #Newsroom #HBO to win something!   It's new, but already a fave show of mine!

Christoph Waltz wins! Ok dont care bout the rest.. #GoldenGlobes
Who has won so far? #GoldenGlobes
Okay Homeland you win, I'll start watching you. Only because I'm so confused on how you're beating Breaking Bad in everything #GoldenGlobes
Why couldn't Jessica Lange and Julianne Moore both win? #GoldenGlobes

I hope Argo wins just to spite the Oscars. #goldenglobes
God the golden globes is such a shit awards show. Only watching to make sure les mis wins as they rightfully should.

Come on Michelle i want you to win!!! #GoldenGlobes #Downton
Anna Karenina was my personal fave here, but Life of Pi will win. #goldenglobes
Fun fact: Leo won his one and only Golden Globe in 2005 for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture for The Aviator. #GoldenGlobes
Golden Globes reference in "Argo" makes the Golden Globes clip of "Argo".  That should be enough to secure a win. #GoldenGlobes
Apparently I need to watch this homeland.... They win every awkward. #overit #GoldenGlobes
#BreakingBad didn't win the award?!?!? 
#rigged #GoldenGlobes

While everyone's watching #GoldenGlobes, I'm watching more of season 2 of The Wire, and pretending it won all the awards ever. #OmarComin

No one thought that guy would win based on how far he had to walk. #goldenglobes
Yeah! Life of Pi won! #GoldenGlobes
#GoldenGlobes Life Of Pi might just win love Ang Lee films
This better be the only award Life of Pi wins tonight. #GoldenGlobes

Honestly didn't think others were allowed to win when John Williams is up for a composing award. And I preferred it that way. #GoldenGlobes
w00t! R @ChrisKnightfilm: Canadian Mychael Danna wins #Goldenglobes for score of Life of Pi.
If CLOUD ATLAS deserves to win one award, it's Best Original Score. I mean... the "Cloud Atlas Sextet." #GoldenGlobes
Mychael Danna, a Canadian, won Best Original Score for Life of Pi. #GoldenGlobes
Congrats to @LifeofPiMovie on their first #GoldenGlobes win! Best Original Score.

Great score!  RT @vulture: Life of Pi wins Best Original Score. #goldenglobes
actually wish cloud atlas had won for best score, the one element the movie got really, really right #goldenglobes

If you won for best score do they cut you off by playing your own score? Questions no one ever asks about the #GoldenGlobes

Lena wins one for #girls #girlsHBO whooop-whoooop üòã Ironically I'm currently missing the season premiere for the #GoldenGlobes
Amy Poehler didn't even have to win. She got to sit on George Clooneys lap. #GoldenGlobes
Much to common male disagreement, Lena wins!!! #GoldenGlobes
‚Äú@arieswym: Amy Poehler won. She got George Clooney whispering sweet nothings in her ear. #GoldenGlobes‚Äù that was def winning and funny
I'm very conflicted over this best actress in a comedy win. Need a few to deal with these emotions. #goldenglobes
@tha_sherminator I know the academy won't give django anything so its cool the golden globes are.
The only Golden Globes tweet I will share is my outrage that Lena Dunham won that award.
Jennifer Lawrence and Quentin Tarantino both won Golden Globes tonight and that makes me very happy
I think they've had to turn the music on for almost every person who has won an award, tonight. #goldenglobes

The Golden Globes are always entertaining to watch. However, it is slightly annoying that Bryan Cranston didn't win for Breaking Bad.
Gah!! #LesMiserables won for best musical film at the #GoldenGlobes ? Well, maybe I missed something when I fell asleep at the theater.
Man, all these Dodge Dart ads make me want to buy a car. You win Dodge Marketing Staff. #GoldenGlobes
I love musicals but I was hoping silver linings would have won that one #goldenglobes
I love that celebrities' Wikipedia pages are updated AS SOON as they win. #GoldenGlobes
I loved Les Miz, buuuut...at least they didn't play Bring Him Home when Jackman won. #smartmove #goldenglobes
Les Mis√©rables wins. Figured as much. Wonderful film. #GoldenGlobes
The musical won the comedy and musical category. Try again next year comedy. #GoldenGlobes
Zero Dark Thirty lost.  Les Mis wins.  And the terrorists win again.  #GoldenGlobes
Movies like Les Mes bother me. They win all the awards despite their mediocrity instead of amazing movies like Silver Linings #GoldenGlobes
You remember when the guy who won best director met his wife on the set of Daredevil? #goldenglobes
Chicago wins #Oscar. Les Mis cleans up #GoldenGlobes. Phantom of the Opera film producers should've thought twice about Gerard Butler.
i love hugh so much, but i thought bradley would win cuz he‚Äòs great in silver linings. hope bradley wins oscars #GoldenGlobes
Yayiee love him !"@timesofindia: #GoldenGlobes Hugh Jackman wins best actor for Les Miserables"
So why did Les Mis win over Silver Linings Playbook bc I can't figure it out? #GoldenGlobes
Proud of self. I actually saw a few movies that won this year #goldenglobes

#Argo wins Best Picture at #GoldenGlobes. Producer forgets to thank Matt Damon on behalf of Ben Affleck. #cmonpeople
Lincoln didn't win? Definitely not for the lack of my bearded Richmond pals who worked as extras. #GoldenGlobe #GoldenGlobes

Wanna bet 'Lincoln' will win best picture at the Oscars? #GoldenGlobes #oscars
"Argo" wins best picture.  That was my favorite but there were many good movies this year.  Tough competetion. #goldenglobes
To sum up #GoldenGlobes I would say: Disappointing, not enough Tina &amp; Amy &amp; too many weird wins that didn't make sense, #night ya'll
Of course James Dolan's table doesn't win the big one lol #GoldenGlobes
Ben Affleck, wins best director &amp; motion picture - drama for Argo, beats veteran directors at the #GoldenGlobes I have to see his movie yet.
wow. totally thought Lincoln was gonna win Best Picture Drama. congrats to @benaffleck and #Argo. #GoldenGlobes. much more deserving win.
Argo was great. Totally deserves the win.  #GoldenGlobes
Around the 12 minute mark of Argo, I said, "This will win best picture at the Oscars." I'd like to put money on it now. #GoldenGlobes
i didn't even scream when argo won. i just sat still, smiled, and teared up a bit. #goldenglobes
Love that Argo won! Ha! #GoldenGlobes
#Argo's win is #Lincoln's death shot at the #GoldenGlobes. Final thought: Argo and Les Miz fans, enjoy!Globes and Oscars= parallel universes
Psyched #argo won. Not only was it great but it was the only nominee that i saw. #argofuckyourself  #GoldenGlobes
Happy that both my Best Actors for 2013 (Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh Jackman) and Best Pictures (#LesMiserables and #Argo) won! #GoldenGlobes

#Argo was best picture at the #GoldenGlobes but #Lincoln is going to win at the #Oscars
I'm kind of shocked that Modern Family didn't win anything! #goldenglobes
I am so exicted to see that #JessicaChastain won best actress tonight at the #GoldenGlobes I have been a fan of her art for some time.
Argo so deserved this win!! #GoldenGlobes
Woohoo! Anne Hathaway won Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture for Les Miserables. #GoldenGlobes
'Silver Linings Playbook' Review http://t.co/pgrK5zjq via @examinercom  Jennifer Lawrence wins Best Actress  at #GoldenGlobes  Congrats!
Argo was the only movie that I saw out of all the movies nominated and it wins for best drama! Do I know movies or what! #goldenglobes
Argo got a couple of wins ... I guess I have to watch it. #GoldenGlobes

I hope the academy feels dumb for not nominating Ben Affleck, now that he won at the Critics Choice Awards and Golden Globes #Snub

They say that #goldenglobes winners tend to be the same as #oscars but.. we know it won't be for best director. Fail Oscars lol
Yes, I admit to a little shout of "Aussie Aussie Aussie" when Hugh won. He was awesome in Les Mis, as was Ms Hathaway. #goldenglobes

Argo won against Lincoln, Django Unchained, Life of Pi. Ben Affleck over Steven Spielberg, Ang Lee, Quentin Tarantno. Say wat? #goldenglobes
Who won what at the Golden Globes ?? #goldenglobes
Lincoln didn't steal everything and Django won best screenplay and supporting actor. I'd call that a sucessful but worthless #GoldenGlobes
