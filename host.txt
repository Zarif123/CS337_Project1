#GoldenGlobes #WorstDressed 10)Tina Fey.This host's L'Wren Scott was not the dress for the leading lady of the night. http://t.co/OcKig4Le
@nbcsnl can we make Amy and Tina the hosts for every year? #GoldenGlobes
Can't stop laughing with the Golden Globes this year. The ceremony needed new hosts.
Having Amy and Tina host the #GoldenGlobes is brilliant! Watching on delay on DVR but so far... Hilarious!
Agreed. Total success! RT @DianaNBC6 Can (Tina Fey) and Amy host the Oscars please?! #GoldenGlobes
Best hosts for the golden globes, ever.
I just love Amy Poehler and Tina Fey so much. Best hosts EVER #GoldenGlobes
#GoldenGlobes has a very feminist tone with the amazing hosts, then Target commercials come and say, "Hey glamorous women, do some laundry."
Amy and Tina by far my fave hosts! #funny #goldenglobes
Where are the hosts? We saw more of Tina and Amy in the promos for the show. #goldenglobes
Why isn't Ryan gosling a host?!?!? "Hey girl...you won a golden globe" #goldenglobes
Jay Leno and Jimmy Fallon are my two favorite late night hosts!! #GoldenGlobes
Comedians always make good hosts period. #GoldenGlobes
When will sacha baron Cohen host the golden globes as one of his characters, preferably borat.
Jimmy Fallon and Jay Leno are the worst people on earth. Like they ruin everything they touch, attend, or host #GoldenGlobes
Paul Rudd should host one of these awards shows. #GoldenGlobes

What a revival in film 2012 was. The #GoldenGlobes really got back to the root of classy &amp; entertaining. Awesome hosts. Quality movies. Love
Can Tina and Amy host the #GoldenGlobes every year? Classy, funny, witty, inspired and succinct.
Kristen Wiig &amp; Will Ferrell for next year's #GoldenGlobes hosts? "Get outta here!" http://t.co/ulqvk3iK
Yes! RT @YahooTV: Should Kristen Wiig and Will Ferrell host next yr's #GoldenGlobes? We think so; see why right here: http://t.co/4tQXdUpo
Kristen Wiig should be the next host of the Golden Globes! Love her SO much.
#goldenglobes you've found your hosts for the next 5 years...Fantastic ...
Yeah. Why even have hosts if you're not going to use them. Just have the announcer guy run the show. #GoldenGlobes
Pwede bang si Amy Poehler at si Tina Fey na din ang host ng Oscar? #GoldenGlobes
Breaking news: @kat_wax and I are next year's hosts of the Golden Globes.
Anne Hathaway has already signed on to host next year's Golden Globes so she can finish her acceptance speech #GoldenGlobes
That girl host looks like Regina George's mom. #GoldenGlobes
Tina and Amy are the best hosts ever. #GoldenGlobes
Next year I want kristen wiig to be host! #GoldenGlobes
Tina Fey &amp; Amy Poehler should host all award shows.  Love them. #GoldenGlobes
@AndKellySays oh definitely!!! ... I also feel as if we could host the #GoldenGlobes ... Tina Fey &amp; Amy Poehler, watch out!! #wearethatfunny
Amy and Tina are awesome. They should host it every year with Ricky Gervais. #goldenglobes
Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are hilarious!! Best host in the #GoldenGlobes ever!
The next time I host the Golden Globes, I'm going up there with a Pearl Light in hand. #premiumlager
2013 Golden Globes live: Tina Fey and Amy Poehler host Hollywood elite - The Guardian (blog) http://t.co/xsOk6Dn1 #hair #fashion
Yup. RT @murraymaker Why do the Golden Globes even have hosts? Tina and Amy have been on for like 47 seconds this entire evening.
@diablocody can u host the #GoldenGlobes next year?
One award left. The thing to take away from tonight? Have Tina Fey and Amy Poehler host EVERYTHING. #goldenglobes
Really #GoldenGlobes, you hire Tina Fey and Amy Poehler to host and don't have them onstage at all? Really golden globes? REALLY?!
Can Tina Fey and Amy Poehler please host every awards show from here on out? #GoldenGlobes
I thought this show had hosts? Where, oh where are Amy and Tina? #GoldenGlobes
I'm still pretty bummed that Amy and Tina did not get a lot of screen time. Hope about they host the Oscars next year? #GoldenGlobes
Loved Tina Fey and Amy Poehler as hosts #GoldenGlobes - what fabulous ladies!
"Goodnight! We're going home with Jodie Foster!" &lt;3 Tina &amp; Amy - they were fantastic hosts! #goldenglobes
You know, the truth is, the host(s) of the Golden Globes don't do much. #goldenglobes
So it's official right, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler should host the oscars! #GoldenGlobes
I am overall pleased with the Golden Globes. I think Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were 2 of the best hosts ever.
Really though can Amy &amp; Tina host every single awards show from now on? They seriously killed it. I nearly died laughing. #goldenglobes
Amy Poehler and Tina Fey were great hosts! Such a good Golden Globes and everyone who won deserves it! #werkk
Tina and Amy were amazing hosts! #goldenglobes
Great Globes.  Amy and Tina were great hosts.  No brainer to have them back next year!  #goldenglobes  #heywomenarefunnytoo
"We're going home with Jodie Foster." Perfect. Just... perfect. They need to host everything with Neil Patrick Harris. #GoldenGlobes
Whyyy?? Hahah, they're going home with Jodie!! Love them! Great hosts! #GoldenGlobes
Best ever! ‚Äú@HuffPostWomen: Can we all just agree that Amy and Tina are the best hosts to ever grace an awards show stage? #goldenglobes‚Äù
Final thoughts: not enough Tina and Amy. Why have them host then? #GoldenGlobes
A disappointing amount of Tina and Amy. Why does this thing even need a host(s)? It seems to do fine on autopilot. #goldenglobes
@alyssaegelhoff and host the golden globes together...?
The cast of #snl needs to host more shows because the #goldenglobes this year was one of the best!
Can #TinaFey and #AmyPoehler host every awards show? Please. #GoldenGlobes
If Amy and Tina don't host everything from now on, Award Shows are doing it wrong. #GoldenGlobes
I think Tina &amp; Amy should host the Oscars &amp; SAG awards as well.  There wasn't enough of them tonight. #GoldenGlobes
Argo deserved it, nice QT screenplay surprise, and Tina and Amy were fucking terrible as hosts. Goodnight! #GoldenGlobes
I never tweet this much but wow one of the greatest award shows i'm ever seen! Tina and Amy need to host everything.  #goldenglobes
Well that was fun. Tina &amp; Amy were amazing hosts. #GoldenGlobes
We can RT @HuffPostWomen Can we all just agree that Amy and Tina are the best hosts to ever grace an awards show stage? #goldenglobes
Would have been happy with more Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. Don't think I've ever thought that about an awards show host! #GoldenGlobes
It would be nice if the hosts of the #GoldenGlobes did more.. You know.. Actual Hosting.
Attention #GoldenGlobes if you're gonna have the brilliant Tina Fey and Amy Poehler host the show, let them HOST ... http://t.co/Ib6Q89gF
Calling them "hosts" was such a tease HFP. Totally underutilized. #goldenglobes
Tina and Amy please host every televised event from now on. PLEASE. #obsessed #GoldenGlobes
SO... to wrap up for the #GoldenGlobes: I personally think it went well overall. The hosts killed it, MOST of the decisions were good.
Best Golden Globes in a while!  Great hosts and congrats to all the winners!  Can't wait for the oscars!
Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were excellent hosts! Bring them back next year!!! #GoldenGlobes
You know you hate those award shows when your favorite comedians host and you still don't watch #GoldenGlobes #sorry
Can we agree at least that Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are the best awards show hosts ever?#GoldenGlobes
#GoldenGlobes this year were solid. Amy Poehler and Tina Fey were baller hosts. Overall, great awards show.
What a solid show! What are your thoughts? Who was best dressed? The winners? The hosts? I want to hear what you think! #GoldenGlobes
‚Äú@lapetitesinge: I have never said this about any awards show host ever before, but: needed more Tina and Amy. #goldenglobes‚Äù agreed.
Pretty tacky for a host to be standing on stage with a drink ! #GoldenGlobes
Seriously, can Tina Fey and Amy Poehler host everything from here on out?  #GoldenGlobes
best golden globes I've seen by far it was hilarious, tina fey n amy poehler were great hosts
Argo for the win! Fantastic final acceptance, hilarious hosts, great moments before the commercial breaks. Success. #Goldenglobes
Remember when the hosts, not the voiceover guy, hosted the show? #goldenglobes
Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were the best hosts in years. Round 2 next year?  #GoldenGlobes
Thanks for joining @davecribb and I your uk tweet hosts of the #goldenglobes
‚Äú@HuffPostWomen: Can we all just agree that Amy and Tina are the best hosts to ever grace an awards show stage? #goldenglobes‚Äù - ABSOLUTELY
There wasn't nearly enough Tina&amp;Amy, but they were terrific hosts. They should host everything-including my next dinner party. #GoldenGlobes
Maybe next year, the Golden Globes will actually let the hosts host the event.
Tina Fey &amp; Amy Pohler should host every award show in my opinion! They did an amazing job &amp; were actually hilarious! #GoldenGlobes
@sethmeyers21 Dear Seth, a request: Amy and Tina host again. And again. As often as they want. #GoldenGlobes
I loved Tina Fey and Amy Poehler as hosts. I just wished we would have seen more of them. #GoldenGlobes
‚Äú@grubreport: The biggest problem with Amy and Tina as hosts was not enough Amy and Tina as hosts. #GoldenGlobes‚Äù Agreed!
Tina and Amy should host absolutely everything. #GoldenGlobes
Great #GoldenGlobes  - Tina and Amy were hilarious hosts and need to host these awards every year!
Already excited to re-watch Amy &amp; Tina's #GoldenGlobes opening. If they don't host again next year then the world is cay-razzie.
Tina and Amy should host the Oscars next it would make them alot less boring #GoldenGlobes
They certainly made NO mistake by getting Tina Fey and Amy Poehler to host! Very entertaining. Love them! Job well done guys! #GoldenGlobes
Amy Poehler and Tina Fey were amazing host at the #GoldenGlobes tonight.
What is the point of having hosts for an award show if they are barely seen!? #GoldenGlobes
#GoldenGlobes kinda left me...not satisfied...really expected to be dying from laughter w Amy and Tina. Are they limiting hosts airtime?
So, how do I get Amy Poehler and Tina Fey to host my future wedding? #goldenglobes
We all know how funny they are, and they were almost non-present as hosts #GoldenGlobes
Can't Tina and Amy just hang out and talk for another hour? Or at least host all other award shows this year? #GoldenGlobes
Golden Globes verdict: A clusterfuck of a shitshow that could've used more Tina and Amy. But they were fantastic hosts. #bitchesgetshitdone
What were your thoughts on the hosts? Here at SMH we thought they were great, just not enough of them #goldenglobes http://t.co/oUSTOqGY
Tina and Amy were fantastic.  Ricky Gervais was fantastic the last few years.  I vote for all three to host next year! #goldenglobes
Hahahaha OMG, Amy is so funny. And Tina!! They should host everything from now on. #GoldenGlobes
I'd be more than happy to see Tina &amp; Amy host the #GoldenGlobes again next year. Anyone else?
Tina Fey and Amy Poehler should host everything ever. #goldenglobes
@nbc  Not enough Tina and Amy! They better host next year and not leave that stage! #GoldenGlobes
Tina Fey and Amy Pohler need to host the #GoldenGlobes every year from now on. Move over Ricky Gervais!
Amy Poehler and Tina Fey were such fantastic hosts! Only wanted more. #GoldenGlobes
Ricky Gervais would like you to know that although he didn't host this year's #GoldenGlobes, he still doesn't believe in God.
Tina Fey and Amy Poehler should host every award show going forward #GoldenGlobes
So can Tina and Amy host the oscars and Grammys too bc I didn't see them enough tonight??? #GoldenGlobes
Tina Fey and Amy Poehler: every woman wants you for their BFF. Please host all the things in the future. #goldenglobes
Where can we sign up to have Tina and Amy host every awards show? #GoldenGlobes
@goldenglobes Great show!! Tina Fey &amp; Amy Poehler MUST host again!

Also, when are tina fey &amp; amy poehler going to host oscars?? they crushed it at #goldenglobes. poehler on clooney's lap during noms = genius
Tina fey and amy poehler best hosts ever! Kristin wiig and will ferrell best presenters ever! #GoldenGlobes
Knowing how brilliant Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were as hosts, I'm dreading Seth MacFarlane's gig even more. #goldenglobes #oscars
Gotta say, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler need to host the #GoldenGlobes every year.
My biggest gripe with tonight's Golden Globes presentation is that the hosts were barely there. #GoldenGlobes
Can we all agree Tina Fey and Amy Poehler should host every award show from now on? Ok? Ok. #GoldenGlobes
Tina &amp; Amy need to host every award show. Tv executives, make it so!!! #GoldenGlobes
