Damien Lewis' posh accent makes him so much more attractive. But of course, this is always the way #homeland #GoldenGlobes

Since Louis CK didn't win, don't think Lena Dunham will win either. I'm ok with that. Rooting for Amy Poehler! #goldenglobes
A well deserved win for Quentin Tarantino. Christoph Waltz's lines in "Django Unchained" were nothing short of sublime. :)  #GoldenGlobes
Looooooooooved Lucy Liu's dress!! #GoldenGlobes

Anne Hathaway is so humble. I love that she embraces where her success began... as Princess of Genovia! haha #GoldenGlobes #PrincessDiaries
It's amazing how Meryl Streep is practically mentioned or nominated at every award almost every year #GoldenGlobes
Lucy Liu looks as coolly pretty as ever, but a messy braid? We're on the fence. What do you think ... fun or tacky?  #GoldenGlobes
From Trainspotting to Moulin Rouge to Salmon Fishing in Yemen, Ewan McGregor has been the most dreamy man to ever exist. #GoldenGlobes

So happy for Lena Dunham! And maybe she was walking funny bc she's a busy tired working woman #goldenglobes
Lena Dunham, everybody. #goldenglobes
Anyone notice how the camera pans away every time Mel Gibson is in the shot? It's like they panic, "omg! Mel &amp; booze!" #GoldenGlobes

Presenting a plate of hamsters to Jodie Foster is the least crazy thing Mel Gibson has ever done. #GoldenGlobes
And that America was Mel Gibson's latest attempt at a career comeback #GoldenGlobes
Oh wow, I had completely missed Mel Gibson right there. Is he um...is he doing better, like...stability-wise, or...?? o_O #GoldenGlobes
LMAO! RT @VanityFair: ‚ÄúYou know what, Taylor Swift. You stay away from Michael J. Fox's son.‚Äù -Tina Fey going there at the #GoldenGlobes.

Jodie Foster: Brave,smart,unwilling 2 live a divided life.Congrats on sharing your full self w the world tonight. Wow #GoldenGlobes
Is Halle Berry ever gonna age?! #GoldenGlobes

Halle Berry is Everything tonite #GoldenGlobes
‚ÄúNormal is not something to aspire to. It is something to get away from‚Äù - Jodie Foster #GoldenGlobes
With that print, those bangles, and those hoops Halle Berry kind of looks like she's going to Bamboo. #GoldenGlobes
I think Jodie Foster just came out, retired, and made everyone cry. #GoldenGlobes
According to my twitter feed, Jodie Foster just made the best AND the worst speech ever at the #GoldenGlobes. That takes skill.
I'm not sure I agree with everything she said/not sure I even followed all of it, but so much respect for Jodie Foster #goldenglobes
‚Äú@ninagarcia: Great quote by Jodie Foster: "normal is not something to aspire" great speech #goldenglobes‚Äù
Halllle Halle Berry #goldenglobes
47 yrs in the business and Jodie Foster doesn't know not to bang on the podium right next to the mic. #goldenglobes
You know a dress is super ugly when not even Halle Berry can make it look good. One boob looks giant &amp; lop-sided. #GoldenGlobes
Halle Berry, asymmetrical boob #goldenglobes
Jodie Foster, sencillamente espectacular... Hermosas palabras. #GoldenGlobes

I hope you've enjoyed me retweeting the Golden Globes backwards for you.

Fun Fact: Les Miserables won for the comedy part, but not for the musical part. #GoldenGlobes
Lo mejor de los #GoldenGlobes fueron las achicadas de Tina Fey para Taylor Swift :)
I guess I have to watch this Les Mis 
#GoldenGlobes
Les Miserables! Just amazing! #GoldenGlobes
Disappointed that Moonrise Kingdom and Silver Linings didn't win. Oh well. #GoldenGlobes

Wishful thinking, I know.... Les Mis was good, but there is such a bias for Musicals with regards to awards. #GoodNotGreat #GoldenGlobes
Anne Hathaway just gets more and more annoying #GoldenGlobes
I hope that if Tina Fey and Amy Poehler show up again that they burn Jay Leno. #GoldenGlobes

Les Miserables winning best comedy/musical over Silver Linings Playbook shows that the #GoldenGlobes are a joke.

Les Miserables wins Best Motion Picture for Comedy/Musical. #goldenglobes
Anne Hathaway is hammered. Or she's just as annoying in real life as the characters she plays. #goldenglobes
Anne Hathaway has become a frantic highschool English teacher at the #GoldenGlobes #ForgotYourTestsAtHome
I like Anne Hathaway a lot less after the #goldenglobes
Do you get the feeling Amanda Seyfried hates Anne Hathaway? #goldenglobes
Anne Hathaway trying to steal the spotlight during the 'Les Mis' win was shameless. Fame whore #GoldenGlobes
ME ENCANTA como se ve Anne Hathaway con el pelo corto &lt;3 #GoldenGlobes
Obviously Les Miserables wins best picture! #GoldenGlobes #bestmovie
The Simpsons never won a Golden Globe, so there you go. #perspective #GoldenGlobes
Me three RT @poplifegirl Yeah, me too. RT @tericee: I guess I really need to see Les Mis now. #GoldenGlobes
Interesting that both winning films (Argo &amp; Les Miserables) were directed by people who were not nominated for Oscars. #GoldenGlobes
Too much Les Mis not enough Fey &amp; Poehler.  #GoldenGlobes

Anne Hathaway...still annoying! #GoldenGlobes #awards
OK. Les Miserables got the Golden Globe so now they can give the Oscar to Silver Linings Playbook. #onlyfair #GoldenGlobes
Les Miserables for the win!!! So happy this movie is getting atleast some of the credit it deserves!! #GoldenGlobes
Since Les Mis won, Silver Linings Playbook isn't getting the Oscar. Also...where's Russell Crowe? #GoldenGlobes
I love Anne Hathaway and everything she stands for. I just wish she would gain her weight back, she's scaring me. #GoldenGlobes
Les Miserables... Win tonight ...!!! #GoldenGlobes
I haven't seen Les Miserables but I've seen the trailer and I can tell you Silver Linings Playbook deserved that win. #GoldenGlobes

I hope Anne Hathaway goes back to being irrelevant because I can't stand her. #GoldenGlobes
I have yet to see Les Miserables... lol. But congrats. #GoldenGlobes
does anyone think Anne Hathaway is probably really annoying in person? #GoldenGlobes
Les Mis is definitely the best film I have seen in a long time. It definitely shows the talent of all involved. #GoldenGlobes
Les Mis!!!! Yes yes yes!!!! #GoldenGlobes #amazing üé•üéº
What have we learned? If you cast Bill Murray in your film, it will be critically acclaimed, but passed over for every award. #GoldenGlobes
it's nice to see Ann Hathaway and Amanda Seyfried showing their support to Jodie Foster #GoldenGlobes #lesbianfriendly
Voy a esperar con ansias la pelicula "Les Miserables" viene el proximo mes a latinoamerica #GoldenGlobes

Musical/Comedy wins boost Oscar chances (no shit). Winners: Lawrence, Jackman, Les Miz. Losers: Salmon Fishing In The Yemen #GoldenGlobes
Jodie Foster ,me gusta esta actriz, digo le creo todos sus personajes....#GoldenGlobes
So Anne Hathaway and Taylor Swift are basically the same person. #GoldenGlobes
Los Globos de Oro, esa loca gala en la que creen conveniente rodear a Mel Gibson de alcohol y jud√≠os. #GoldenGlobes #GlobosDeOro
I don't understand why Comedies and musicals are lumped into the same category. Les Miz is hardly a comedy. Weird. #goldenglobes
not gonna lie, seeing Eddie Redmayne standing between Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway was my favorite part #GoldenGlobes
I see from my timeline that the Golden Globe awards is to women what NFL playoffs is to men. #goldenglobes #NFL
Les Miserables!!  Sorry to say I haven't seen the other four.... Will work on that! #GoldenGlobes
#GoldenGlobes I don't have to go to the bathroom but I will, just in case that damn Diet Pepsi ad comes up again
Can't stand overwrought musicals. No interest in seeing Les Miz, even after the #Goldenglobes
Congrats Les Mis Cast. I am lovin this year's #GoldenGlobes

Pretty sure Jodie Foster cost us about 4 good bits with Poehler and Fey. #goldenglobes
Takeaways: more Tina Fey/Amy Poehler is always a good thing. And I guess I should see Argo. Love a good awards show! #goldenglobes
I really did not understand what Jodie Foster was getting at. Is she gay? Is she ending her career? No idea #GoldenGlobes
Sneak attack Julia Roberts @goldenglobes much...poof!

If we learned anything tonight, it's that Amy Poehler -- when inebriated enough -- is ready for the Glenn Close biopic. #GoldenGlobes

Silver Linings Superior to Les Miss by. Yard.  You got not wrong
"@nbcsnl: Just thinking ahead, but like should Will Ferrell and Kristen Wiig host the #GoldenGlobes together next year??" BOOM!!!
Golden Globes, lots of fashion messes...but glad Argo won. Really good movie, along w Moonrise Kingdom and Salmon Fishing Yeman.
